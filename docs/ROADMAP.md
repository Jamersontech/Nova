# NOVA Master Architecture Roadmap

**Status:** Active — established in Section 01.
**Purpose:** Name the architectural domains NOVA must eventually address, and record
which have been completed.

These are **major architectural domains, not necessarily 46 separate coding sessions.**
Future sections may combine closely related domains when that produces a better
implementation. Sections are not strictly sequential; dependencies matter more than
numbering.

> **Who may exercise that latitude (added in Section 02).** Combining, resequencing, or
> redefining sections is a **C3 architectural change — James's decision alone**. The
> paragraph above describes James's latitude, not an agent's. A coding agent reads this
> roadmap to determine which section owns its work, and stops when the work belongs
> elsewhere. See [`architecture/IDENTITY_AND_AUTHORITY.md`](./architecture/IDENTITY_AND_AUTHORITY.md)
> Part II and [ADR 0008](./decisions/0008-architectural-governance-model.md).

Do not add sections merely to enlarge the roadmap. The roadmap changes only when a
genuine architectural requirement or a discovered problem justifies the change.

## Progress

| Section | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 01 — Constitution & Project Foundation | **Complete** |
| 02 — System Architecture & Master Blueprint | **Complete — architecture Accepted by James 2026-08-12** |
| 03 — Data Architecture & Information Model | Next |
| 04 and beyond | Not started |

**No sections were added, removed, renumbered, or redefined in Section 02.** All 46 domains
stand as established in Section 01.

## Section 01 — Completed

Established the constitution, domain model, canonical AI terminology, agent principles,
development rules, change management, design principles, decision-record practice, and
coding-agent governance. No application code, infrastructure, dependencies, or technology
commitments were created.

## Section 02 — Completed

**System Architecture & Master Blueprint.** Produced [`architecture/`](./architecture/README.md):
the scope tree, context tokens, system layers, and the agent, orchestration, execution,
data, permission, memory, tool, model, event, reliability, interface, scale, and testing
architectures — plus ADRs `0001`–`0008` recording the reasoning.

Resolved the Section 01 audit findings M-1 (LIFE), M-2 (multi-business), M-3 (identity), and
M-4 (roadmap authority). **No technology was selected** — every technology decision in
[`decisions/DEFERRED_DECISIONS.md`](./decisions/DEFERRED_DECISIONS.md) remains open by
intent.

## Section 03 — Next

**Data Architecture & Information Model.** [`architecture/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./architecture/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md)
defines the conceptual entities and the invariants any implementation must enforce.
Section 03 selects storage technology and the physical isolation strategy (`D-02`, `D-03`,
`D-33`), and should begin by resolving `Q-01`, `Q-02`, `Q-04`, `Q-07`, and `Q-08`.
